Day 16 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge!
Today, I explored the core of searching techniques in Java — foundational knowledge for every developer preparing for interviews!
🔍 Linear Search & Binary Search — two classic algorithms that form the backbone of efficient data retrieval.
📌 Problem Statement
 Given an array and a target value, determine whether the element exists in the array and return its index.
➡️ For example:
arr = {10, 20, 30, 40}, target = 30
 🔍 Output: 2 (for both linear and binary if the array is sorted for binary)
🛠️ Solutions Implemented
1️⃣ Linear Search
 🔹 Method: Traverse the array sequentially to find the target value.
 🔹 Best Use: Unsorted or small-sized datasets.
 Time Complexity: O(n)
 Space Complexity: O(1)
2️⃣ Binary Search
 🔹 Method: Repeatedly divide the sorted array to locate the target efficiently.
 🔹 Best Use: Large sorted arrays where speed matters.
 Time Complexity: O(log n)
 Space Complexity: O(1)
🎯 Key Takeaways
 ✅ Revisited essential array search operations.
 ✅ Strengthened understanding of algorithmic complexity.
 ✅ Practiced edge case handling (null/empty arrays).
 ✅ Gained confidence in implementing classic algorithms in Java.
